# PS_adjoint_imaging_2D

This code package can perform full wavefield seismic imaging using adjoint P and S wave equations.

This method has been used in micro-earthquake source imaging [1,2] and Earth structure imaging [3].

Please cite the following three papers if you use this code in your publications:
