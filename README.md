# PS_adjoint_imaging_2D

This code package can perform full wavefield seismic reflection imaging using adjoint P and S wave equations, which is parallelized using Message Passing Interface (MPI) techniques under C programming. Note that this code was originally developed to run on Intel HPC slurm system. Be aware of errors running on any other platforms.

This method [1] has been applied to volcanic structure imaging submitted to a journal paper [2].

Please cite the GJI methodology paper [1] and the submitted volcano application paper [2], if you use this code for your publications:
